            <p> Maite Perroni Beorlegui is my hero because she has showed me that even if your at the bottom you need to keep reaching for what you want even when times are tuff. She has showed everybody that you can do anything you want and mostly if you have the opportunity to. When you have talent and you are focused you can get whatever you want. She has taught me to keep my head up high when times are ruff. She was a poor little girl who lived in Guadalajara and know look at her  she is a famous actress, singer, song writer, and model she was just like any one of us but if we try our hardest we can acheive what ever we want.
